    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    I'm a data analyst who believes data tells stories. I specialize in Python, APIs, and data visualization. I love uncovering patterns in datasets and transforming them into insights that actually mean something. 
    My perfect project? One where I get to dive deep into research (yes, I'm that person with 50 browser tabs open), discover surprising patterns, create beautiful visualizations, and share what I learned. Bonus points if it involves entertainment data: TV shows, music, games, or anything that explores why audiences love what they love.
    I am interested in pursuing opportunities that combines analytical rigor with creative curiosity.
